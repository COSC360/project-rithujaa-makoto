# <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Project Proposal - MyDiscussionForum</span>


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Description</span>

We are going to work on project number 2 which is MyDiscussionForum Website. The **MyDiscussionForum** website will allow registered users to engage in online discussions and unregistered users to view discussions. This allows users to register, post stories and make comments on items. Additionally, unregistered users will be able to view the content but will not be able to edit or comment on posts.
